# Udacity Front End Dev Nanodegree

###First Project
The first project is simply an "about me" page. Find my work in FE Nanodegree Project 0.

###Project 2: Portfolio
A basic portfolio site. Find work in directory called Project 1.
In setting up this project, I used yeoman to generate a directory structure that works with grunt. In addition, I configured grunt to use two plugins for handling responsive images.
*Grunt-responsive-images* which automatically converts single images into different sizes, and *grunt-respimg*, which both converts and compresses. See https://www.npmjs.com/package/grunt-respimg for a detailed explaination of the workflow.
